=== DEPENDENCIES ===

To make the code compileable, the following requirements have to be met:
1. Installed Visual Studio 2012.
2. Installed DirectX SDK.
3. Downloaded external dependencies:
    * "Deps" directory created in repository root with content downloaded form here:
      https://drive.google.com/?tab=wo#folders/0B_NOQKNycAqtbHQyYjFBcURnLW8

      https://drive.google.com/?tab=wo#folders/0B6zK51CguCdCUmdlR3lRbS1fTnc
    * NOTE: it is convenient to use Google Drive application to synchronize these folders
      automatically and create symbolic links to them:
	    - on Windows: "mklink /J <dest> <src>"
	    - on Linux: "ln -s <src> <dest>"


=== DOCUMENTATION ===

Doxygen documentation can be generated using "gen_doc.bat" script. Doxygen needs to be installed
in the system and "doxygen" command must be visible in the shell.


=== FORMATTING ===

Keep the code format consistent. Run format.bat script to format the code automatically.
