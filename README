=== INTRODUCTION ===

nfEngine is an open source 3D game engine.

# TODO: fill this section


=== DEPENDENCIES ===

To make the code compileable, the following requirements have to be met:
1. Installed Visual Studio 2012.
2. Installed DirectX SDK.
3. Downloaded external dependencies from this folder:
   https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/#folders/0B66mya2agFOEd0RJUWx1aDZ6Ym8
    * "Deps" directory created in repository root with content copied from subfolder nfEngineDeps
    * "Data" directory created in "nfEngineTest" with content copied from subfolder nfEngineTestData
    * NOTE: it is convenient to use Google Drive application to synchronize
      these folders automatically (by adding this folder to your drive)
      and create symbolic links to them:
	    - on Windows: "mklink /J <dest> <src>", e.g.:
	    	- cd nfengine // go to root of repository
	    	- mklink /J Deps "path-to-nfEngineDeps"
	    	- cd nfEngineTest
	    	- mklink /J Data "path-to-nfEngineTestData"
	    - on Linux: "ln -s <src> <dest>"


=== DOCUMENTATION ===

Doxygen documentation can be generated using "gen_doc.bat" script. Doxygen needs to be installed
in the system and "doxygen" command must be visible in the shell.


=== FORMATTING ===

Keep the code format consistent. Run format.bat script to format the code automatically.
ArtisticStyle needs to be installed in the system and "astyle" command must be visible
in the shell.

ArtisticStyle can be downloaded here:
